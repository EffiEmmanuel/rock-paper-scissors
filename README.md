Hi, this is my version of the popular Rock, paper, scissors game!
I made use of Adobe Illustrator for the UI Design and HTML, CSS
 and Javascript for Front-end Decelopment.

I made use of more functions as opposed to my previous projects.

I have not had so much time to practice mostly because of school but I believe
I have improved a little bit since my last project.

This was a really fun project and I really love to know what you think!
